A simple smart contract in Solidity that registers and counts user interactions as a form of "enthusiasm" — such as likes, reactions, votes, or other acknowledgments. Here’s an example of a basic Ethereum smart contract in Solidity:

What this contract does: Each user can add a "reaction" (e.g., a click, vote, or like). Reactions are stored in userReactions and summed in totalReactions. It emits a ReactionAdded event, which can be tracked off-chain (e.g., in a frontend application). The contract owner can reset the counter.

If you’d like, we can expand this contract to include:

Tokens as rewards for reactions

Integration with oracles to fetch data from external sources (e.g., Twitter/X, Reddit)

A reputation system or enthusiasm levels
